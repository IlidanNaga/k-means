Just an idea:

1) generating centers of further clusters
2) making a 'web' of control points (have to thing about their placement)
3) wireing this web to the cluster centers, we get pretty realistic split of the plane
4) generating points, ones which connect to no centers - removed
5) as a result we get a set of non-connecting clusters (which still needed to be detected), which fills almost all the plane
6) clustering as "find points which are close enought and wire them", if you have way too many points in one cluster - try to split them into several new ones


Right now i have:

1) generating centers
2) finding length between this centers
3) finding the closest of all of the lengthes
4) generating random points in range -0.7 - 0.7
5) generating random list of belongings to centers
6) moving this point to the square near the generated center, size of square - def too cmall
7) dieing in attempt to use prev generation of cluster making, rn no clusterisation done


What we have to do... once again:

20x20 : 0.1  44 100 

Right now i have vector - column
also i need a vector - line for easy broadcasting
